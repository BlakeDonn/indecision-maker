## In Action

#### Take 1

- When the user first opens the application it is welcome with  the homepage that renders an welcoming message that introduces the to the user with an existential question that makes us wonder about our own decisions. 

 - The Viwer can interact with the navigation bar that allows the user see the application's content such as music, movies, podcasts, card games and board games.

#### Take 2
- When the user clicks on the `find activity button`, the applications view changes to present the viewer witht the `find activity form`. 

- When the user answers the questionnaire the script collects the user informations and passes it to the parent compoentn `<App/>`, this way the algorithm handled by the parent will filter and randomize an actvity.

    - The first `option` is to select the activity suggested by the application.
    - The second `option` is to skip the suggested activity and choose another one that randmoizes the next suggested activity
